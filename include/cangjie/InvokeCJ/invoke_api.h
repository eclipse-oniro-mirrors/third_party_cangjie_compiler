 * @note the C thread that calls Cangjie function doesn't become a fiber, it is still a native
 * thread. It means, that it will not be preempted during the execution of Cangjie code and this
 * thread will not start execution other  tasks from fibers queue. That's why such synchronous
 * calls of Cangjie code should be done with caution.
